                <p>My name is Jeaustin Sanabria. I was born in Cartago, Costa Rica, 
                but I have lived in New Jersey ever since I was 11 months old. Some 
                of my interests include everything car related, soccer, and video 
                games. I have always been the type of person who liked to figure out 
                what makes thinks work, which is what sparked my interest in coding. 
                I had originally wanted to go to school for mechanical engineering, 
                but I was offered a position at a previous employer that gave me 
                direct experience in the field. After time, I realized it was not 
                what I wanted my career path to be and I always found myself coming 
                back to computers. I hope to one day use my coding to create my own 
                start-up and run my own business.</p>
