            <p>My name is Jeaustin Sanabria. I was born in Cartago, Costa Rica, but I have lived in New Jersey ever since I was 11 months old. Some of my interests include everything car related, soccer, and video games. I have always been the type of person who likes to figure out what makes thinks work, which is what sparked my interest in coding. I hope to one day use my coding to create my own start-up and run my own business. </p>
